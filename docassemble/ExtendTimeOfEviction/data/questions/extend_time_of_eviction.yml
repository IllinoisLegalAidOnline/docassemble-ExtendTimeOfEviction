  Extend time of eviction
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Extend time of eviction** Easy Form.

  This program will help you create documents asking for more time in your rental unit before being evicted.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**asking for more time to move out after an eviction**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/asking-more-time-move-out-after-eviction).

  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need a copy of the **{Eviction Order}** that was entered against you.

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  
  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some questions have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that also gives help.
terms:
  - "Eviction Order": |
      If your landlord has already won an eviction lawsuit against you to force you to leave your house or apartment, the judge will have issued an order. This order is called an Eviction Order.

continue button field: stay_period
question: |
  Stay period
subquestion: |
  Most Eviction Orders are **{stayed}** for a number of days. The sheriff cannot evict you until the stay period is over. 

  **Important:** It is best to file the motion made by this program before the stay period ends. After the stay period, the Sheriff can follow the court order to evict you.

  After you file the motion, you should hand deliver a copy of the motion and the **{Notice of Motion}** to the sheriff's office in the courthouse where the motion will be heard.
  
  If your motion is not heard in court before the stay period ends, the Sheriff can evict you. Giving the Sheriff a copy of your motion may delay the Sheriff from evicting you before your motion is heard, but the Sheriff could still evict you. You can ask your local sheriff's office what their policy is.
  
   If your residence is in Cook County and you file your motion within 30 days of entry of the eviction order, the Cook County Sheriff should not enforce the eviction order while the motion is pending.
terms:
  - "stayed": |
       If an order is stayed, it does not go into effect right away.
  - "Notice of Motion": |
      This is a form telling other parties in a lawsuit that you have filed a motion and when the motion will be heard in court. This interview will create a **Notice of Court Date for Motion** for you.

  Why do you need more time to move out?
subquestion: |
  In the box below, tell the court why you need more time. If you can, explain how the new deadline will let you move out of your current home by ${ move_out_date }.
  
  Here are some examples:

  * "I have been searching but could not find an apartment large enough for my family until last week. We will be able to move into our new apartment when our lease begins on ${ move_out_date}."
  * "I have had difficulty finding a new place to live because I do not have a vehicle. I have found a new residence within walking distance of my workplace. I will be able to rent a truck and move my belongings into the new residence on ${move_out_date}."
  * "I could not search for a new apartment because I was in the hospital recovering from an injury. I need more time to research available apartments within driving distance of my workplace and apply for a lease."
  * "I have had difficulty finding a new place to live because I have mobility issues stemming from my disability. I have found some potential residences that meet my accessibility needs, and I am in the process of applying for a lease at one of them."
  
  The form has room for about 10 lines of text, or about 730 characters. You can preview it on the next screen. If you have a document that helps show why you need more time, such as a doctor's note, you may want to include a copy of it with your forms.
